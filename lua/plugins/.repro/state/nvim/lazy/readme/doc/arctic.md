## Introduction

I fell in love with VSCode Dark+ theme at first sight. At that time, I made up
my mind that I would port it to Neovim. Now, here it is. All the colors are
defined as strictly and precisely as possible, including the editor itself and
UI. I only adapted the plugins I was using, but presumably most plugins with
their default highlight settings should look harmonious. If you need a specific
support, please open an issue.

## New Version

VSCode is rolling out the successor of Dark+ that is called **Dark Modern**. Currently
only the UI theme colors have been updated and it is still in the experimental
stage. If you want to give it a shot, please checkout the `v2` branch.

## Installation

Using `vim-plug`

```vim
Plug 'rktjmp/lush.nvim'
Plug 'rockyzhang24/arctic.nvim'
```

Using `packer`

```lua
use {
  "rockyzhang24/arctic.nvim",
  requires = { "rktjmp/lush.nvim" }
}
```

Using `lazy.nvim`

```lua
{
  "rockyzhang24/arctic.nvim",
  dependencies = { "rktjmp/lush.nvim" },
  name = "arctic",
  branch = "main",
  priority = 1000,
  config = function()
    vim.cmd("colorscheme arctic")
  end
}
```

## Usage

Simply set the colorscheme with the builtin command `:colorscheme`

```vim
" Vimscript
colorscheme arctic
```

```lua
-- Lua
vim.cmd("colorscheme arctic")
```

## Customization

This theme was built with `rktjmp/lush.nvim`, so the customization and is quite
easy. Just open `arctic.nvim/lua/lush_theme/arctic.lua` and execute `:Lushify`.
Then you can adjust colors or relink highlight groups to suit your taste, and it
gives you real time feedback. For details regarding how to use `lush.nvim`, see
[rktjmp/lush.nvim](https://github.com/rktjmp/lush.nvim).
